    - using CDN
    - create-react-app

<!-- 
    as you can see from the above index.html, we have only
    one div with a class root and script
    the root div is the gateway to connect all react components
    to the index.html
    in the script tag, we will write js, but the script type
    will be babel
    babel will transpile the react jsx to pure js on browser
