<!-- 
    we can get started with react in 2 ways:
    - using CDN
    - create-react-app

<!-- 
    as you can see from the above index.html, we have only
    one div with a class root and script
    the root div is the gateway to connect all react components
    to the index.html
    in the script tag, we will write js, but the script type
    will be babel
    babel will transpile the react jsx to pure js on browser

    the babel library is linked to our document and now
    we can make use of it
    next step: importing react and reactDOM using CDN or link
    in order to link them, we attach both packages from CDN
    to the body of index.html
    to test if react is linked to index.html, do console.log(React)
    open the browser console and you should get an object
    if you see an object containing react methods then
    you managed to link your project with react CDN and 
    are ready to use react
